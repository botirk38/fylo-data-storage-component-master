## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

In this project, I learned how to utilize CSS Flexbox and Grid for layouts, ensuring that the webpage is responsive and user-friendly on all devices. Working on the Fylo data storage component allowed me to understand how to manage the layout on different screen sizes and to use CSS properties effectively.

Some of the code I'm proud of includes:

```css
.storage-left{
    display:flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    margin-top:-4.5rem;
    margin-bottom: 2rem;
    margin-left:1rem;
    background-color: white;
    width:100%;
    height:auto;
    min-height:100px;
    max-width:250px;
    border-radius: 15px;
}

.storage-left span{
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    margin-bottom: 1rem;
    margin-top: 1rem;
    margin-left: 1rem;
    margin-right: 1rem;
    font-size: 1.5rem;
}

```
### Continued Development
In the future, I would like to continue focusing on making my projects more interactive with JavaScript. Moreover, I'm planning to explore more about React and Next.js to make my projects more dynamic.

### Useful Resources
The CSS Flexbox Guide - This helped me to understand the flexbox layout and how to use it effectively.
